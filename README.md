# 👋 Hi, I'm Marc!

Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm currently learning and growing as a frontend web developer. I use this space to **archive my projects**, track my progress, and share things I've been building.

## 💻 What I Do

- I work mostly with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**
- I've built a handful of **basic to intermediate** frontend projects
- I enjoy experimenting with layouts, UI components, and interactive features
- My goal right now is to keep learning, building, and improving my skills 💪

## 📁 What You'll Find Here

- Personal frontend projects — from simple UIs to more interactive pages
- Experiments and test projects as I explore new concepts
- Clean, readable code with a focus on structure and style

## 🧠 What I'm Learning

- Making cleaner and more responsive layouts
- Improving my **JavaScript** logic and DOM manipulation
- Exploring frontend best practices and code organization

## 📫 Let's Connect

I'm always open to feedback, tips, or just chatting about dev stuff.  
Feel free to check out my projects or drop a message if you're curious about anything!

> Thanks for stopping by ✨  
> More updates coming soon as I learn and build more 🚀
Would you like me to include badges (like tech stacks, GitHub stats), or do you prefer keeping it minimal?
