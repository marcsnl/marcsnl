# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Marc!

Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm currently learning and growing as a frontend web developer. I use this space to **archive my projects**, track my progress, and share things I've been building.

## ðŸ’» What I Do

- I work mostly with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**
- I've built a handful of **basic to int ermediate** frontend projects
- I enjoy experimenting with layouts, UI components, and interactive features



##Would you like me to include badges (like tech stacks, GitHub stats), or do you prefer keeping it minimal?
