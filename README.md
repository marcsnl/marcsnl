This is an archive for my projects.

I'm Marc, I prompt (LLMs) logics for the programs produced within this archive.

In turn, I study and review generated codes to understand and replicate it on my own.

Huge respect for developers, programmers, and coders who manually write codes with little to no help from any LLMs.

But time and resources are limited.
