# 👋 Hi, I'm Marc!

Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm currently learning and growing as a frontend web developer. I use this space to **archive my projects**, track my progress, and share things I've been building.

## 💻 What I Do

- I work mostly with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**
- I've built a handful of **basic to intermediate** frontend projects
- I enjoy experimenting with layouts, UI components, and interactive features
- My goal right now is to keep learning, building, and improving my skills 💪

## 📁 What You'll Find Here

- Personal frontend projects — from simple UIs to more interactive pages
- Experiments and test projects as I explore new concepts
- Clean, readable code with a focus on structure and style


Would you like me to include badges (like tech stacks, GitHub stats), or do you prefer keeping it minimal?
